- Start up your Sun or Moon game or Ultra games
- Before selecting your save file, press home button to let the game hang on home menu
- On Wonder Injector enter your 3DS IP address and connect. It shouldn't error provided you gave the right address.
- After doing so, press the home button again to select your games save file, then play as you normally would but select any pokemon or wondercard files you wish for the program and just press inject... OR press dump save file to dump that to your chosen directory when that function is live

## Make your pokemon files all you wish on pkhex > found here https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/

## and making things easier with editing your personal pokemon from your game by just dumping your save directly to the PC via the ftp connection this program makes so you can then just insta inject them again when finished.
