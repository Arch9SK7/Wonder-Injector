# Instructions to use this:

Find your 3ds IP via either homebrew launcher or ftpd or whatever methods...
then...

- Boot up 3ds and run NTR CFW 3.6 or later
- Start up your Sun or Moon game or Ultra games
- Before selecting your save file, Enable debugger within Rosalina menu of Luma CFW.
- On Wonder Injector enter your 3DS IP address and connect. It shouldn't error provided you gave the right address.

## Tada You can now inject to your hearts content without removing your SD card :) 

## Make your pokemon files all you wish on pkhex > found here https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/

## and making things easier with editing your personal pokemon from your game by just dumping your save directly to the PC via the ftp connection this program makes so you can then just insta inject them again when finished.
